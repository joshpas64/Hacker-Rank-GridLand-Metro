# Hacker-Rank-GridLand-Metro
Attempt to solve the GridLand Metro problem in Java using Eclipse
Comments will and descriptions will come as I work to fully solve the problem
in a way I feel is efficient enough

Main Issue is sorting and rearranging a linked list containing coordinates of tracks in a row
There are likely several implementations so I might keep several in different braches

As of now there is some source code of a finished attempt I completed. Can track progress by going through branches.

Eventually best solution will be Master Branch. Will make sure to explain each file in each branch with comments or readme's
as I can over time.
First branch for now is First Finished Solution
